## Prompt Basics

### What is a Prompt?

A prompt is your creative starting point—the text or phrase you use to tell Midjourney what kind of image you want. Your prompt could be just one word or a complete phrase. The more thought you put into your prompt, the more unique and interesting your image can be.

### Prompting Tips & Tricks

Short and simple prompts typically generate the best images with Midjourney. Use phrases that clearly describe what you want to see. Think of it like giving a quick snapshot of your idea. Avoid making long lists or detailed instructions; these can confuse the process.

**❌ Poor Example:**
> Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils

**✅ Better Example:**
> Colored pencil illustration of bright orange California poppies

### Key Prompting Principles

#### 1. Choose the Right Words
The words you pick matter! Try using specific synonyms. For example, instead of "big," consider "huge," "gigantic," or "enormous." Being precise can help get better results.

#### 2. Be Specific with Numbers
Plural words like "cats" can be vague. Instead, use specific numbers like "three cats." Or go for collective nouns like "flock of birds" instead of just "birds."

#### 3. Focus on What You Want
Describe what you do want instead of what you don't. If you mention a party with "no cake," a cake might still appear. For excluding items, use the `--no` parameter.

### Prompt Length and Details

Your prompts can be simple—even a single word or emoji works. Short prompts let Midjourney's default style fill in the gaps. But if specific elements are important to you, be sure to include them. Fewer details mean more variety, but you get less control over the outcome.

Be clear about details that matter to you. Here are some areas to consider:

- **Subject:** Who or what? (person, animal, character, location, object)
- **Medium:** In what form? (photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry)
- **Environment:** Where? (indoors, outdoors, on the moon, underwater, in the city)
- **Lighting:** What kind? (soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights)
- **Color:** In what shades? (vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel)
- **Mood:** Feelings to evoke? (playful, calm, gloomy, energetic)
- **Composition:** How is it framed? (portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view)

### Advanced Prompts

Once you're comfortable with basic prompts, start exploring more advanced options:

- **Text Prompt:** The text description of what you want to see. Well-written prompts help generate amazing images!
- **Image Prompts:** Adding images to your prompt influences the style and content of your new creations through Image Prompts, Style References, and Character References.
- **Parameters:** Tools that let you customize how an image is generated. They can adjust things like aspect ratios to tailor your image to your liking. Parameters get added to the end of your prompt.

## Modifying Your Creations

Once you've made an image with Midjourney, your creative journey doesn't have to stop there. You have a range of tools at your fingertips to modify and enhance your images.

### Variations
Variations (Vary) let you create multiple versions of your image with subtle or strong differences. This is particularly useful when you're happy with your original image but are curious about changes that could make it even better.

### Upscale
Upscaling takes your image to the next level by enlarging its dimensions. **Creative Upscale** not only boosts the size but also adds subtle improvements, perfect for when your image needs that extra polish. To enlarge your image without altering it, use **Subtle Upscale**.

### Remix
Remix is a powerful feature that lets you make iterations on your image by changing the prompt text. With Remix, you have the freedom to change both the prompt and the parameters you've set, allowing you to creatively steer how your images develop.

### The Editor
Midjourney's Editor includes Pan, Zoom Out, and Vary Region (the erase tool) all in one interface, if you'd like to make several changes at once. You can also use the individual tools on their own.

#### Pan
With Pan, you can expand the canvas of your image in a specific direction to add more content and change its aspect ratio.

#### Zoom Out
Zoom Out gives you the ability to add more context and elements around all four sides of your original image, effectively expanding it beyond its current borders.

#### Inpainting (Vary Region/Erase)
Vary Region/Erase is perfect for editing specific parts of your image, allowing for precise alterations without changing the rest of the image.

### Use in a New Prompt
The "Use" buttons allow you to quickly and easily use your generated image as an image prompt, style reference, or add the prompt text to your Imagine bar to make changes and run the prompt again.

### Animate
The animate tools give you the ability to turn your image into a captivating 5 second video. Use the Auto buttons to jump right in, or the Manual buttons to adjust your prompt text for the video.

## Aspect Ratio

### What is Aspect Ratio?

Aspect ratio is a way to describe how wide and tall an image is. It's shown as two numbers, like 1:1 or 4:3, that tell you how the width compares to the height. By default, Midjourney images are square (1:1).

Choosing an aspect ratio helps you decide if your image will be wide (landscape) or tall (portrait). Use a bigger first number for a wide image and a bigger second number for a tall image.

**Important:** Aspect ratio isn't the same as image dimensions. The final size of your Midjourney images will also depend on the Midjourney version and Upscaler you're using.

### Setting the Aspect Ratio

Add `--ar #:#` to the end of your prompt in the Imagine bar.

### Common Aspect Ratios

- **1:1** – Perfect square, popular for social media profile pictures and posts
- **4:3** – Slightly rectangular, used in older TV screens and computer monitors
- **2:3** – Common in printed photography and picture frame sizes
- **16:9** – Widescreen, the standard for HD videos and most modern TVs
- **9:16** – Vertical orientation, common for mobile content on social media

## Art of Prompting

Unlock a world of creativity with Midjourney by exploring the power of words. While single-word prompts can yield stunning images, the true magic happens when you mix in different concepts like artistic mediums, time periods, environments, and more.

### Artistic Mediums

Try adding these medium descriptors to your prompts (example: `[medium] style cat`):

- Block Print
- Ballpoint Pen Sketch
- Cyanotype
- Graffiti
- Paint-by-Numbers
- Risograph
- Ukiyo-e
- Pencil Sketch
- Watercolor
- Pixel Art
- Blacklight Painting
- Cross Stitch
- Acrylic Pour
- Cut Paper
- Pressed Flowers
- Oil Painting

### Time Periods

Specify historical eras for period-appropriate imagery (example: `illustration of a [period] cat`):

- 1400s through 2000s (by century)
- 1910s through 1990s (by decade)

### Emotions

Add emotional depth to your subjects:

- Shy
- Determined
- Sad
- Joyful
- Angry
- Happy
- Depressed
- Sleepy

### Colors

Experiment with color schemes (example: `[color] colored cat`):

- Millennial Pink
- Acid Green
- Pink and Blue
- Canary Yellow
- Sepia
- Two Toned
- Pastel
- Duotone
- Ebony
- Neutral
- CMYK
- Indigo
- Iridescent
- Brightly
- Grayscale
- Neon

### Environments

Place your subjects in various settings:

- Tundra
- Salt Flat
- Jungle
- Desert
- Forest
- Cave
- Farm
- Crystal Forest
- City
- Garden
- Suburban

## Best Practices for Robot Prompters

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with basic prompts and gradually add complexity
2. **Be Precise:** Use specific descriptors rather than vague terms
3. **Experiment:** Try different combinations of mediums, moods, and environments
4. **Iterate:** Use variations and remix features to refine your results
5. **Document Success:** Keep track of prompts that produce excellent results
6. **Mix Elements:** Combine artistic mediums with time periods or emotions for unique effects
7. **Use Parameters:** Don't forget to add parameters like `--ar` for aspect ratio control

Remember: The key to mastering Midjourney is experimentation. Each prompt is an opportunity to discover something new and unexpected!
